# Book-Recommendation-Project
Project that uses machine learning to make book recommendations to a user.

This project uses data from Open Library and Goodreads to compute cosine similarity scores, which are subsequently used to recommend books to a user. Some additional information based on a user's profile is also given, such as their most read authors and genres.
